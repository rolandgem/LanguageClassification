# LanguageClassification

The code for the language classification problem is found in the notebook language_classification.ipynb.

The code reads in a data file called lang_data.csv which is found in this directory.

The trained models are saved as pickle files (.pkl). There are 3 trained models based on decision tree, random forest, and gradient boost.

These trained models can be loaded as decribed in the notebook and used to classify new data.
